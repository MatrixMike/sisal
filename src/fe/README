We are quite lucky that the grammar is available in the SISAL 1.2
ref manual. The grammar became my parse rules without any changes
and then the AST variant type, again without changes!

I dont do this now:
"As in the case of field names, a tag name may coincide with any
other name without conflict and the same tag name may be used
in several union types without conflict."
